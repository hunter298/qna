  # The first argument to `can` is the action you are giving the user
  # permission to do./
  # If you pass :manage it will apply to every action. Other common actions
  # here are :read, :create, :update and :destroy.
  #
  # The second argument is the resource the user can perform the action on.
  # If you pass :all it will apply to every resource. Otherwise pass a Ruby
  # class of the resource.
  #
  # The third argument is an optional hash of conditions to further filter the
  # objects.
  # For example, here the user can only update published articles.
  #
  #   can :update, Article, :published => true
